* `_Misc` contains a collection of random scripts.
* `Logger` is a dynamic file logger.
* `UtilityAI-Static` is a static framework for a The Sims like Utility driven decision making engine.
* `DurielEditorTools` is an addon that improves game performance when run from edit mode by switching to the script editor on focus loss, and by disabling drawing of the editor while the game runs. (See the new toogle.) And forces the side panels to have a minimum width. Oh, and it removes the asset lib button.
